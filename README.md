# NFL Game Spread Betting Model

## Overview and History

After learning basic machine learning tactics and being exposed to sports gambling around the same time, I set out to accomplish what I have wanted to do my entire life: make money off of my knowledge of sports and my natural affinity for numbers. Currently, this has not yet been achieved as my model is far from perfect. However, the goal has and will always stay the same. I will continue to scour the internet for more data, dive deeper into new advanced algorithms, and tweak my model until it is perfect. Vegas will not get the better of me.


## Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
This where the brunt of my work has taken place thus far. And it has come very far from where I started.

#### Iteration One
My first batch of data came in csv titled spreadspoke_scores and contained data on every NFL game dating back to 1966, and this was quickly supplemented by a file named nfl_elo which contained the ELO of NFL teams dating back to 1920. ELO is a common measurement used across many sports to determine the general strength of an entity in that sport. After cleaning, training and testing this data, I found little success in creating a model that was useful for monetary prediction.

#### Iteration Two
After initial models showed disappointing results, I believed the solution lie in gathering more data. I couldn't
