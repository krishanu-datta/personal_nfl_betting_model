# NFL Game Spread Betting Model

## Overview and History

After learning basic machine learning tactics and being exposed to sports gambling around the same time, I set out to accomplish what I have wanted to do my entire life: make money off of my knowledge of sports and my natural affinity for numbers. Currently, this has not yet been achieved as my model is far from perfect. However, the goal has and will always stay the same. I will continue to scour the internet for more data, dive deeper into new advanced algorithms, and tweak my model until it is perfect. Vegas will not get the better of me.
